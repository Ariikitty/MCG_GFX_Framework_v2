# MCG_GFX_Framework_v2
 Light weight graphics library for drawing shapes
 
 ## The project
 This software is part of my uni corse to create a c++ application to draw a circle, triangle and perform a matrix transformation using a lightweight graphics library that only draws 1 pixel to the screen
 
 ## Current Progress
 Currently the program will draw 2 red pixels, one in the center of the screen and one in the top left of the screen
